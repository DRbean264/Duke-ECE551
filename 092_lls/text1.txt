I got stuck in the 24th broken implementation. Can you give me some hint?
I've tried delete an element in a list which contains multiple of the same value;
delete the list with a single element;
delete the tail element;
delete the head element;
delete the non-existing element;
delete the middle element;
delete all the elements.
I still couldn't find what went wrong.
