For this assignment, we are offering extra credit for doing each
step in a timely fashion.  In particular, you should complete Steps 1-3
by the following intermediate deadlines:

Step 1 by Friday 11/12
Step 2 by Wednesday 11/17
Step 3 by Monday 11/22

Completion of these intermediate deadlines translates into extra credit
points as follows:

  * All three deadlines met: +10 points on the assignment
  * Two out of three deadlines met: +6 points on the assignment
  * One out of three deadlines met: +3 points on the assignment

Your grade on this assignment can go over 100% (e.g., you could earn 95% + 10 points extra credit = 105%).

If you fail to meet those deadlines, we still give a bit of extra
credit for completing Step 1 by 11/17 AND Step 2 by 11/22.  Doing
such will give +3 points (as if meeting one deadline), but requires
BOTH Step 1 and Step 2 by the later deadline.  Note that if you do
Step 3 by 11/22 also, you can earn that +3 also for a total of +6.

To consider the deadline as being met, you must pass the Pre-grader's tests by the end of the day
(11:59:59PM) on the date specified.  The pregrader will run a set of its own tests prior to running
your tests, and will state specifically if you passed them.  Look for a line like this:
Step 1: PASSED Pre-Grader Test Cases
in its output. 

To claim your extra credit, create a file called

myec.txt

and put a line with the step and the commit ID, such as:

Step 1: 279254ff497489567b50f0e50d05a97f10aaf8e0

You can get the commit id from "git log", and it will look like a big hex number as above. The
commit you have should contain the grade.txt file showing that you passed the pre-graders test cases.
Place one line per deadline met.    


Note that the pre-grader's test cases required for the extra credit are:
  Step 1:
    - Be able to handle any page in story1 or story2
  Step 2:
    - Be able to play through story1 and story2, winning or losing
  Step 3:
    - Compute story depths of story1 and story2.
  Step 4: (not related to extra credit)
    - Print all wins in story1 and story2.
