> One day, a strange old wizard comes to your village and tells you that

> What would you like to do?

>  1. Choose the magic whistle.

> 
> After knocking on the door, Denevieve is surprised to hear about the dragon
> threat but is happy to help you. After all, you were her best student and
> tested every piece of code extensively and incrementally. Surely you can be
> trusted with a quest about dragons.
> 
> The two of you set off into the hills and find the cave of the dragon. You

> 
> What would you like to do?
> 
>  1. Silent Night, accompanied by raven calls
>  2. Angels We Have Heard on High, accompanied by roosters crowing
>  3. Bohemian Rhapsody, accompanied by the magestic call of a bald eagle
> You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing
> 
> "Si--iii-lent niiight" (CAW CAW CAW)
> "Ho--oly night" (CAW CAW).
> "Aaaalll iiss calm aaaalll is bright" (CAW CAW).
> 
> As Denevieve sings and you make bird calls, the dragon comes out of his
> cave looking quite angry. 
> 
> "WHO DARES DISTURB MY SLUMBER... Oh hello. You look tasty."
> 
> The dragon eats you.

> Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
