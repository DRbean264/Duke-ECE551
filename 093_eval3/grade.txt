> One day, a strange old wizard comes to your village and tells you that
> there is an evil dragon lurking in the hills. This wizard's story explains
> why the village's goats and cows have been going missing lately.
> 
> The wizard tells you: "It is up to you, hero, to stop this dragon. Nobody
> else in this village is foolish...errrr I mean brave enough to stop this
> dragon." 
> 
> The wizard offers you a choice of one of three magic items to help you on
> your quest. 
> 
> The first is a magic whistle that lets you make any bird call that you
> want. The second is a pair of magic shoes that let you jump 10 feet in the
> air. The third is a magic toaster, which can take any item that you can fit
> into it, and turn it into perfectly cooked toast (optionally with butter
> and/or jam). 
> 
> "Choose wisely, for your quest and your village depend on you."
> 
> What would you like to do?
> 
>  1. Choose the magic whistle.
>  2. Choose the magic shoes.
>  3. Choose the magic toaster.

> 
> The two of you set off into the hills and find the cave of the dragon. You
> take a minute to confer about your musical options and come up with a short
> list of three possible combinations to tame the dragon.

> 
>  1. Silent Night, accompanied by raven calls
>  2. Angels We Have Heard on High, accompanied by roosters crowing
>  3. Bohemian Rhapsody, accompanied by the magestic call of a bald eagle
