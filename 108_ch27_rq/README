As always, read and understand Chapters 27, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt".  

For questions 1--6, consider the following tree:

                      55
                    /    \ 
                   32      77
                  /  \   /   \
                 16  50 68    90
                /      /  \   / 
               8      66  73 80  
                         /  \ 
                        70  75
			
For questions 1--4, consider this tree as an AVL tree.
For questions 5--6, consider this tree as a Red/Black tree.

   all paths from the root to NULL [do not include NULL nodes in this count]:

A. 1
B. 2
C. 3
D. 4
E. 5
F. 1 or 2  [i.e., some colorings have 1, others have 2]

C. 50
D. 64
E. 66
F. 68

7. What is the worst case time complexity for the "insert" operation
   in a balanced BST? (n is the number of nodes in the tree)

A. O(1)
B. O(lg(n))
C. O(n)
D. O(n*lg(n))

8. What is the worst case time complexity for the "delete" operation
   in AVL tree?	(n is the number of nodes in the tree)

A. O(1)
B. O(lg(n))
C. O(n)
D. O(n*lg(n))

9. Which of the following is INCORRECT about the principles of forming
   a red-black tree?

A. The root node is black.
B. If a node is red, its children must be black.
C. If a node is black, its children must be red.
D. Each path from root to leaf node has the same number of black nodes.

10. Which of the following is not accurate regarding properties of AVL and
    red-black trees? 

A. Both AVL tree and red-black tree always have each node balanced
   (as defined by the difference in their children's heights)
B. Both AVL tree and red-black tree take O(log(n)) time for basic operations,
   like lookup, insertion and deletion. 
C. Both AVL tree and red-black tree make use of rotations to
   preserve the balance.
D. None of the above (all are accurate)

11. Which of the following describes the relationship between the
    set of all valid red-black trees and the set of all valid AVL trees:

A.  AVL is a strict super set of red-black:  every red-black tree is
    AVL balanced, but there exist AVL trees for which no red-black coloring exists
B.  Red-black is a strict super set of AVL:  every AVL tree can be
    red-black colored, but there exist red-black tree which are not AVL balanced.
C.  The two are the same: any valid AVL tree can be red-black colored,
    and any valid red-black tree is a valid AVL tree
D.  None of the above
